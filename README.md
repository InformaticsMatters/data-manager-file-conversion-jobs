Data Manager job definitions for file conversions.

## Contributing
The project uses [pre-commit] to enforce rules on files prior to committing
them to the upstream repository. You **MUST** comply with this style to
contribute to the project.

To get started review the pre-commit utility and then setup your local
clone by following the **Installation** and **Quick Start** sections: -

    pip install -r build-requirements.txt
    pre-commit install

Now the project's pre-commit rules will run on every commit, and you can
test everything's OK now with: -

    pre-commit run --all-files

---
